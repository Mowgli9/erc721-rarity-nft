ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ Disclamer : I don't suggest you to use this smart contract, It was only for me to learn more about Solidity ` Who the f* wrote this smart contract ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† `



# Description 
    In this project, I tried to create NFTs with rarities {common,
    rare, super rare, epic, legendary}
    you can set the URIs in the smart contract
    I tried to explain the smart contract with comments
    but if you still have a question, DM Mowgli#7713
    I interact with smart contract using the delicious framework Brownie

# DISCALMER 

    Only for educational purposes

# What you need to interacte with it 

    - Brownie
    - Infura or Alchemy or Moralis endpoint
    - this config works only with rinkeby testnet if you want to another network
        you need to change {brownie-config.yaml}
    - Link token in your wallet you can get faucet , ETH for fees
    - I think that's all ^^' if you still have a question DM Discord Mowgli#7713
